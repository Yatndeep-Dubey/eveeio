					We never want our customers to feel that way, so our refund policy is simple: If you're ever unhappy with Zenrate Technologies ,
					for any reason, just contact our support team and we'll take care of you</p>

				<p className="font-bold text-xl">Examples of partial refunds we'd grant.</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					1. If you forgot to cancel Zenrate Technologies  a year ago, and there's been activity on your account since then, we'll review your account usage and figure out a partial refund based on how many months you used it.
					<br />
					2. If you upgraded your account a few months ago to a higher plan, but you didn't end up using the extra features, projects, or storage space, although you did keep using Zenrate Technologies  in general, we'd consider applying a prorated credit towards future months.
					<br />
					3. If we had extended downtime (multiple hours in a day, or multiple days in a month) or you emailed customer service and it took multiple days to get back to you, we'd issue a partial credit to your account.
